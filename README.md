# MapAnimation

### Description 
The assignment was to simulate PacMan biting down across the screen. I used four different images of PacMan. I was able to update them giving the illusion he was eating. 

### Installation
It was made in the browser. No additional software is necessary.  

### Usage
Click the button. SetTimeout with loop through an array of cooridnates to show the bus stops from MIT to Harvard.

### Roadmap
Add a highlight line to go along with the mapping.
